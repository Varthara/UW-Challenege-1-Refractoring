This repository contains the solution to a refractoring assignment given to students of the University of Washington 2022 Summer Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. 
For the assignment, students were asked to meet the folowing acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN I view the source code 
THEN I find semantic HTML elements 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements 
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
WHEN I view the icon and image elements 
THEN I find accessible alt attributes 
WHEN I view the heading attributes 
THEN they fall in sequential order 
WHEN I view the title element 
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
